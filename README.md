World Alpha is an autonomous research synthesis engine that monitors global macro, policy, and geopolitical developments and compresses them into structured, mechanism-grounded intelligence. It produces conviction-ranked narratives and cross-theme interaction maps — without prescribing instruments, pairs, or positions.
