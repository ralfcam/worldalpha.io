# World Alpha — Thematic Taxonomy

## Design intent

Themes are structural research categories, not asset classes.
They cut across instruments, geographies, and time horizons.
Mapping to instruments is the user's responsibility.

## Tagging rules

  - Every promoted item: 1 primary theme + up to 2 secondary themes.
  - Cross-theme interactions format: PRIMARY × SECONDARY
    Example: MONETARY_POLICY × GEOPOLITICAL_RISK
  - Watchpoints may carry theme tags without mechanism chains.
  - Do not create ad-hoc themes outside this taxonomy.
    If a new theme is needed, propose it via Linear issue:
    theme [🟡 medium] with rationale.
  - EQUITY_REGIME is SECULAR horizon by default. Cross-theme
    interactions with MONETARY_POLICY and LIQUIDITY_CREDIT are
    expected at conviction ≥ 7; map explicitly in the cross-theme
    interaction block.
